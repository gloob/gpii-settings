NVDA,General Settings,Language,Combo box,"This is a combo box which allows you to select the language that NVDA's user interface and messages should be shown in. There are many languages, however the default option is ""User Default, Windows"". This option tells NVDA to use the language that Windows is currently set to."
NVDA,General Settings,Save Configuration on exit,Checkbox,"This option is a checkbox that, when checked, tells NVDA to automatically save the current configuration when you exit NVDA."
NVDA,General Settings,Show exit options when exiting NVDA,Checkbox,"This option is a checkbox that allows you to choose whether or not a dialog appears when you exit NVDA that asks what action you want to perform. When checked, a dialog will appear when you attempt to exit NVDA asking whether you want to exit, restart or restart with add-ons disabled. When unchecked, NVDA will exit immediately."
NVDA,General Settings,Play sounds when starting or exiting NVDA,Checkbox,"This option is a checkbox that, when checked, tells NVDA to play sounds when it starts or exits."
NVDA,General Settings,Logging level,Combo box,"This is a combo box that permits you to choose how much NVDA will log as it's running. Generally users should not need to touch this as not too much is logged. However if you are wanting to provide information in a bug report, then it may be a useful option."
NVDA,General Settings,Automatically start NVDA after I log on to Windows,,"If this option is enabled, NVDA will start automatically as soon as you log on to Windows. This option is only available for installed copies of NVDA."
NVDA,General Settings,Use NVDA on the Windows Logon screen (requires administrator privileges),,"If you log on to Windows by providing a user name and password, then enabling this option will make NVDA start automatically at the logon screen when Windows starts. This option is only available for installed copies of NVDA."
NVDA,General Settings,Use currently saved settings on the logon and other secure screens (requires administrator privileges),On-Off button,"Pressing this button copies your currently saved NVDA user configuration to NVDA's system configuration directory, so that NVDA will use it when running on the logon, User Account Control (UAC) and other secure Windows screens. To make sure that all your settings are transferred, make sure to save your configuration first with control+NVDA+c or Save configuration in the NVDA menu. This option is only available for installed copies of NVDA."
NVDA,General Settings,Automatically check for updates to NVDA,,"If this is enabled, NVDA will automatically check for updated versions of NVDA and inform you when an update is available. You can also manually check for updates by selecting Check for updates under Help in the NVDA menu."
NVDA,Synthesizer Selection,Synthesizer,,"This option allows you to choose the synthesizer you wish NVDA to use for speech output. For a list of the Synthesizers that NVDA supports, please see the Supported Speech Synthesizers section. One special item that will always appear in this list is ""No speech"", which allows you to use NVDA with no speech output what so ever. This may be useful for someone who wishes to only use NVDA with Braille, or perhaps to sighted developers who only wish to use the Speech Viewer."
NVDA,Synthesizer Selection,Output device,,This option allows you to choose the sound card that NVDA should instruct the selected synthesizer to speak through.
NVDA,Synthesizer Selection,Audio Ducking Mode,"   No Ducking: NVDA will never lower the volume of other audio.
    Duck when outputting speech and sounds: NVDA will only lower the volume of other audio when NVDA is speaking or playing sounds. This may not work for all synthesizers.
    Always duck: NVDA will keep the volume of other audio lower the whole time NVDA is running. ","On Windows 8 and above, this option allows you to choose if NVDA should lower the volume of other applications while NVDA is speaking, or all the time while NVDA is running."
NVDA,Voice Settings,Voice,Combo box,"The first option that you land on in this dialog is a combo box listing all the voices of the current synthesizer that you have installed. You can use the arrow keys to listen to all the various choices. Left and Up arrow take you up in the list, while right and down arrow move you down in the list."
NVDA,Voice Settings,Variant,Combo box,"If you are using the Espeak synthesizer that is packaged with NVDA, this is a combo box that lets you select the Variant the synthesizer should speak with. ESpeak's Variants are rather like voices, as they provide slightly different attributes to the eSpeak voice. Some variants will sound like a male, some like a female, and some even like a frog."
NVDA,Voice Settings,Rate,Slider 0 to 100,"This option allows you to change the rate of your voice. This is a slider that goes from 0 to 100, (0 being the slowest, 100 being the fastest)."
NVDA,Voice Settings,Pitch,Slider 0 to 100,"This option allows you to change the pitch of the current voice. It is a slider which goes from 0 to 100, (0 being the lowest pitch and 100 being the highest)."
NVDA,Voice Settings,Volume,Slider 0 to 100,"This option is a slider which goes from 0 to 100, (0 being the lowest volume and 100 being the highest)."
NVDA,Voice Settings,Inflection,Slider,This option is a slider that lets you choose how much inflection (rise and fall in pitch) the synthesizer should use to speak with. (The only synthesizer that provides this option at the present time is eSpeak).
NVDA,Voice Settings,Automatic Language switching,Checkbox,This checkbox allows you to toggle whether NVDA should switch speech synthesizer languages automatically if the text being read specifies its language. This option is enabled by default. Currently only the eSpeak synthesizer supports automatic language switching.
NVDA,Voice Settings,Automatic Dialect switching,Checkbox,"This checkbox allows you to toggle whether or not dialect changes should be made, rather than just actual language changes. For example, if reading in an English U.S. voice but a document specifies that some text is in English U.K., then the synthesizer will switch accents if this option is enabled. This option is disabled by default."
NVDA,Voice Settings,Punctuation/Symbol Level,,"This allows you to choose the amount of punctuation and other symbols that should be spoken as words. For example, when set to all, all symbols will be spoken as words. This option applies to all synthesizers, not just the currently active synthesizer."
NVDA,Voice Settings,Trust voice's language for processing symbols and characters,,"On by default, this option tells NVDA if the current voice's language can be trusted when processing symbols and characters. If you find that NVDA is reading punctuation in the wrong language for a particular synthesizer or voice, you may wish to turn this off to force NVDA to use its global language setting instead."
NVDA,Voice Settings,Capital pitch change percentage,Edit field,"This edit field allows you to type the amount that the pitch of the voice will change when speaking a capital letter. This value is a percentage, where a negative value lowers the pitch and a positive value raises it. For no pitch change you would use 0."
NVDA,Voice Settings,"Say ""cap"" before capitals",Checkbox,"This setting is a checkbox that, when checked, tells NVDA to say the word ""cap"" before any capital letter when spoken as an individual character such as when spelling. Usually, NVDA raises the pitch slightly for any capital letter, but some synthesizers may not support this well, so perhaps this option may be of use."
NVDA,Voice Settings,Beep for capitals,Checkbox,"If this checkbox is checked, NVDA will make a small beep each time it encounters a capitalized character by itself. Like the ""say cap for capitals"" checkbox, this is useful for Synthesizers that can't change their pitch for capital letters."
NVDA,Voice Settings,Use spelling functionality if supported, ," Some words consist of only one character, but the pronunciation is different depending on whether the character is being spoken as an individual character (such as when spelling) or a word. For example, in English, ""a"" is both a letter and a word and is pronounced differently in each case. This option allows the synthesizer to differentiate between these two cases if the synthesizer supports this. Most synthesizers do support it. This option should generally be enabled. However, some Microsoft Speech API synthesizers do not implement this correctly and behave strangely when it is enabled. If you are having problems with the pronunciation of individual characters, try disabling this option. "
NVDA,Braille Settings,Braille Display,Combo box," The first option you will come upon in the braille settings dialog is a combo box that says ""braille display"". You will be presented with several options depending on what braille display drivers are available on your system. Move between these options with the arrow keys. 
No braille means that you are not using braille. Please see the Supported Braille Displays section for more information about supported braille displays. "
NVDA,Braille Settings,Port,Combo box," This option, if available, allows you to choose what port or type of connection will be used to communicate with the braille display you have selected. It is a combo box containing the possible choices for your braille display. By default, NVDA employs automatic port detection, which means the connection with the braille device will be established automatically by scanning for available USB and bluetooth devices on your system. However, for some braille displays, you may be able to explicitly choose what port should be used. Common options are ""Automatic"" (which tells NVDA to employ the default automatic port selection procedure), ""USB"", ""Bluetooth"" and legacy serial communication ports if your braille display supports this type of communication. This option won't be available if your braille display only supports automatic port detection. You may consult the documentation for your braille display in the section Supported Braille Displays to check for more details on the supported types of communication and available ports. "
NVDA,Braille Settings,Output Table,Combo box,"The next option you will come to in this dialog is the braille output table combo box. In this combo box, you will find braille tables for different languages, braille standards and grades. The chosen table will be used to translate text into braille to be presented on your braille display. You can move from braille table to braille table in the list by using the arrow keys. "
NVDA,Braille Settings,Input Table,Combo box," Complementary to the previous option, the next setting you will find is the braille input table combo box. The chosen table will be used to translate braille entered on your braille display's Perkins-style keyboard into text. NVDA currently only supports computer braille input, so only 8 dot computer braille tables will be shown. You can move from braille table to braille table in the list by using the arrow keys. Note that this option is only useful if your braille display has a Perkins-style keyboard and this feature is supported by the braille display driver. If input is not supported on a display which does have a braille keyboard, this will be noted in the Supported Braille Displays section. "
NVDA,Braille Settings,Expand to computer braille for the word at the cursor,,This option allows the word that is under the cursor to be displayed in non-contracted computer braille.
NVDA,Braille Settings,Show Cursor,,"This option allows the braille cursor to be turned on and off. It applies to the system caret and review cursor, but not to the selection indicator. "
NVDA,Braille Settings,Cursor Blink Rate (ms),Numerical field,This option is a numerical field that allows you to change the blink rate of the cursor in milliseconds. 
NVDA,Braille Settings,Cursor Shape,,This option allows you to choose the shape (dot pattern) of the braille cursor. The selection indicator is not affected by this option. 
NVDA,Braille Settings,Message Timeout (sec),Numerical field,This option is a numerical field that controls how long NVDA messages are displayed on the braille display. Specifying 0 disables displaying of these messages completely. 
NVDA,Braille Settings,Braille Tethered to, ,"This option allows you to choose whether the braille display will follow the system focus, or whether it follows the navigator object / review cursor. "
NVDA,Braille Settings,Read by Paragraph,,"If enabled, braille will be displayed by paragraphs instead of lines. Also, the next and previous line commands will move by paragraph accordingly. This means that you do not have to scroll the display at the end of each line even where more text would fit on the display. This may allow for more fluent reading of large amounts of text. It is disabled by default. "
NVDA,Braille Settings,Avoid splitting words when possible,," If this is enabled, a word which is too large to fit at the end of the braille display will not be split. Instead, there will be some blank space at the end of the display. When you scroll the display, you will be able to read the entire word. This is sometimes called ""word wrap"". Note that if the word is too large to fit on the display even by itself, the word must still be split. If this is disabled, as much of the word as possible will be displayed, but the rest will be cut off. When you scroll the display, you will then be able to read the rest of the word. Enabling this may allow for more fluent reading, but generally requires you to scroll the display more. "
NVDA,Keyboard Settings,Keyboard layout,Combo box,This combo box lets you choose what type of keyboard layout NVDA should use. Currently the two that come with NVDA are Desktop and Laptop. 
NVDA,Keyboard Settings,Use capslock as an NVDA modifier key,Checkbox,"If this checkbox is checked, the extended insert key (usually found above the arrow keys, near home and end) can be used as an NVDA modifier key. "
NVDA,Keyboard Settings,Use numpad insert as an NVDA modifier key,Checkbox," If this checkbox is checked, the insert key on the number pad can be used as an NVDA modifier key. If no key is chosen as the NVDA key it may be impossible to access certain NVDA commands. Therefore, The Keyboard Settings dialog will display an error message if all keys are unselected when pressing Ok. After dismissing the error message, you must select at least one before being able to press Ok to dismiss the dialog properly. "
NVDA,Keyboard Settings,Speak Typed Characters,,"When enabled, NVDA will announce all characters you type on the keyboard. "
NVDA,Keyboard Settings,Speak Typed Words,,"When enabled, NVDA will announce all words you type on the keyboard. "
NVDA,Keyboard Settings,Speech interrupt for typed characters,,"If on, this option will cause speech to be interrupted each time a character is typed. This is on by default. "
NVDA,Keyboard Settings,Speech interrupt for Enter key,,"If on, this option will cause speech to be interrupted each time the Enter key is pressed. This is on by default."
NVDA,Keyboard Settings,Allow skim reading in Say All,,"If on, certain navigation commands (such as quick navigation in browse mode or moving by line or paragraph) do not stop Say All, rather Say All jumps to the new position and continues reading. "
NVDA,Keyboard Settings,Beep if Typing Lowercase Letters when Caps Lock is On,,"When enabled, a warning beep will be heard if a letter is typed with the shift key while caps lock is on. Generally, typing shifted letters with caps lock is unintentional and is usually due to not realising that caps lock is enabled. Therefore, it can be quite helpful to be warned about this. "
NVDA,Keyboard Settings,Speak Command Keys,,"When enabled, NVDA will announce all non-character keys you type on the keyboard. This includes key combinations such as control plus another letter. "
NVDA,Keyboard Settings,Handle keys from other applications,,"This option allows the user to control if key presses generated by applications such as on-screen keyboards and speech recognition software should be processed by NVDA. This option is on by default, though certain users may wish to turn this off, such as those typing Vietnamese with the Unikey typing software as it will cause incorrect character input. "
NVDA,Mouse Settings,Report Mouse Shape Changes,Checkbox,"A checkbox, that when checked means that NVDA will announce the shape of the mouse pointer each time it changes. The mouse pointer in Windows changes shape to convey certain information such as when something is editable, or when something is loading etc. "
NVDA,Mouse Settings,Enable mouse tracking,,"When enabled, NVDA will announce the text currently under the mouse pointer, as you move it around the screen. This allows you to find things on the screen, by physically moving the mouse, rather than trying to find them through object navigation. "
NVDA,Mouse Settings,Text unit resolution,,"If NVDA is set to announce the text under the mouse as you move it, this option allows you to choose exactly how much text will be spoken. The options are character, word, line and paragraph. "
NVDA,Mouse Settings,Report role when mouse enters object,,"If this checkbox is checked, NVDA will announce the role (type) of object as the mouse moves inside it."
NVDA,Mouse Settings,Play audio coordinates when mouse moves,Checkbox,"Checking this checkbox makes NVDA play beeps as the mouse moves, so that the user can work out where the mouse is in regards to the dimensions of the screen. The higher the mouse is on the screen, the higher the pitch of the beeps. The further left or right the mouse is located on the screen, the further left or right the sound will be played (assuming the user has stereo speakers or headphones). "
NVDA,Mouse Settings,Brightness controls audio coordinates volume,Checkbox,"If the ""play audio coordinates when mouse moves"" checkbox is checked, then checking this checkbox means that the volume of the audio coordinates beeps is controled by how bright the screen is under the mouse. This setting is unchecked by default. "
NVDA,Review Cursor Settings,Follow System Focus, ,"When enabled, The review cursor will always be placed in the same object as the current system focus whenever the focus changes. "
NVDA,Review Cursor Settings,Follow System Caret,,"When enabled, the review cursor will automatically be moved to the position of the System caret each time it moves. "
NVDA,Review Cursor Settings,Follow mouse cursor,,"When enabled, the review cursor will follow the mouse as it moves. "
NVDA,Review Cursor Settings,Simple Review mode,,"When enabled, NVDA will filter the hierarchy of objects that can be navigated to exclude objects that aren't of interest to the user; e.g. invisible objects and objects used only for layout purposes. "
NVDA, Object Presentation Settings,Report Tool Tips,Checkbox,"A checkbox that when checked tells NVDA to report tool tips as they appear. Many Windows and controls show a small message (or tool tip) when you move the mouse pointer over them, or sometimes when you move the focus to them. "
NVDA, Object Presentation Settings,Report Help Balloons,Checkbox,"This checkbox when checked tells NVDA to report help balloons as they appear. Help Balloons are like tool tips, but are usually larger in size, and are associated with system events such as a network cable being unplugged, or perhaps to alert you about Windows security issues. "
NVDA, Object Presentation Settings,Report Object Shortcut Keys,Checkbox,"When this checkbox is checked, NVDA will include the shortcut key that is associated with a certain object or control when it is reported. For example the File menu on a menu bar may have a shortcut key of alt+f. "
NVDA, Object Presentation Settings,Report object position information, ,This option lets you choose whether you wish to have an object's position (e.g. 1 of 4) reported when moving to the object with the focus or object navigation.
NVDA, Object Presentation Settings,Guess Object Position Information when unavailable,," If reporting of object position information is turned on, this option allows NVDA to guess object position information when it is otherwise unavailable for a particular control. When on, NVDA will report position information for more controls such as menus and toolbars, however this information may be slightly inaccurate. "
NVDA, Object Presentation Settings,Report Object descriptions,Checkbox,Uncheck this checkbox if you don't wish to have the description reported along with objects.
NVDA, Object Presentation Settings,Progress bar output,," This option controls how NVDA reports progress bar updates to you. It has the following options: 
    Off: Progress bars will not be reported as they change.
    Speak: This option tells NVDA to speak the progress bar in percentages. Each time the progress bar changes, NVDA will speak the new value.
    Beep: This tells NVDA to beep each time the progress bar changes. The higher the beep, the closer the progress bar is to completion.
    Beep and speak: This option tells NVDA to both beep and speak when a progress bar updates. "
NVDA, Object Presentation Settings,Report background progress bars,Checkbox,"This is an option that, when checked, tells NVDA to keep reporting a progress bar, even if it is not physically in the foreground. If you minimize or switch away from a window that contains a progress bar, NVDA will keep track of it, allowing you to do other things while NVDA tracks the progress bar."
NVDA, Object Presentation Settings,Report dynamic content changes, ,Toggles the announcement of new content in particular objects such as terminals and the history control in chat programs.
NVDA,Input Composition Settings,Automatically report all available candidates,,"This option, which is on by default, allows you to choose whether or not all visible candidates should be reported automatically when a candidate list appears or its page is changed. Having this option on for pictographic input methods such as chinese New ChangJie or Boshiami is useful, as you can automatically hear all symbols and their numbers and you can choose one right away. However, for phonetic input methods such as chinese New Phonetic, it may be more useful to turn this option off, as all the symbols will sound the same and you will have to use the arrow keys to navigate the list items individually to gain more information from the character descriptions for each candidate."
NVDA,Input Composition Settings,Announce Selected Candidate,,"This option, which is on by default, allows you to choose whether NVDA should announce the selected candidate when a candidate list appears or when the selection is changed. For input methods where the selection can be changed with the arrow keys (such as Chinese New Phonetic) this is necessary, but for some input methods it may be more efficient typing with this option turned off. Note that even with this option off, the review cursor will still be placed on the selected candidate allowing you to use object navigation / review to manually read this or other candidates."
NVDA,Input Composition Settings,Always include short character descriptions for candidates,,"This option, which is on by default, allows you to choose whether or not NVDA should provide a short description for each character in a candidate, either when its selected or when its automatically read when the candidate list appears. Note that for locales such as Chinese, the announcement of extra character descriptions for the selected candidate is not affected by this option. This option may be useful for Korean and japanese input methods."
NVDA,Input Composition Settings,Report changes to the reading string,,"Some input methods such as Chinese New Phonetic and New ChangJie have a reading string (sometimes known as a precomposition string). You can choose whether or not NVDA should announce new characters being typed into this reading string with this option. This option is on by default. Note some older input methods such as Chinese ChangJie may not use the reading string to hold precomposition characters, but instead use the composition string directly. Please see the next option for configuring reporting of the composition string."
NVDA,Input Composition Settings,Report changes to the composition string,,"After reading or precomposition data has been combined into a valid pictographic symbol, most input methods place this symbol into a composition string for temporary storage along with other combined symbols before they are finally inserted into the document. This option allows you to choose whether or not NVDA should report new symbols as they appear in the composition string. This option is on by default."
NVDA,Browse Mode Settings,Maximum Number of Characters on One Line,,This field sets the maximum length of a line in browse mode (in characters).
NVDA,Browse Mode Settings,Maximum Lines Per Page,,This field sets the amount of lines you will move by when pressing page up or page down while in browse mode.
NVDA,Browse Mode Settings,Use screen layout,,"This option allows you to specify whether content in browse mode should place content such as links and other fields on their own line, or if it should keep them in the flow of text as it is visually shown. If the option is enabled then things will stay as they are visually shown, but if it is disabled then fields will be placed on their own line."
NVDA,Browse Mode Settings,Automatic Say All on page load,Checkbox,This checkbox toggles the automatic reading of a page after it loads in browse mode. This option is enabled by default.
NVDA,Browse Mode Settings,Include layout tables,,"This option affects how NVDA handles tables used purely for layout purposes. When on, NVDA will treat these as normal tables, reporting them based on Document Formatting Settings and locating them with quick navigation commands. When off, they will not be reported nor found with quick navigation. However, the content of the tables will still be included as normal text. This option is turned off by default."
NVDA,Browse Mode Settings,Configuring reporting of fields such as links and headings,,"Please see the options in the Document Formatting Settings dialog to configure the fields that are reported when navigating, such as links, headings and tables."
NVDA,Browse Mode Settings,Automatic focus mode for focus changes,,"This option allows focus mode to be invoked if focus changes. For example, when on a web page, if you press tab and you land on a form, if this option is checked, focus mode will automatically be invoked."
NVDA,Browse Mode Settings,Automatic focus mode for caret movement,Checkbox,"This option, when checked, allows NVDA to enter and leave focus mode when using arrow keys. For example, if arrowing down a webpage and you land on an edit box, NVDA will automatically bring you into focus mode. If you arrow out of the edit box, NVDA will put you back in browse mode."
NVDA,Browse Mode Settings,Audio indication of Focus and Browse modes,,"If this option is enabled, NVDA will play special sounds when it switches between browse mode and focus mode, rather than speaking the change."
NVDA,Browse Mode Settings,Trap non-command gestures from reaching the document,,"Enabled by default, this option allows you to choose if gestures (such as key presses) that do not result in an NVDA command and are not considered to be a command key in general, should be trapped from going through to the document you are currently focused on. As an example, if enabled, if the letter j was pressed, it would be trapped from reaching the document, even though it is not a quick navigation command nor is it likely to be a command in the application itself."
NVDA,Document Formatting Settings,,Checkbox," Most of the checkboxes in this dialog are for configuring what type of formatting you wish to have reported as you move the cursor around documents. For example, if you check the report font name checkbox, each time you arrow onto text with a different font, the name of the font will be announced.
You can configure reporting of:
    Font name
    Font size
    Font attributes
    Text alignment
    Colors
    editor revisions
    Emphasis
    Text style
    Spelling errors
    Page numbers
    Line numbers
    Line indentation
    Paragraph indentation (e.g. hanging indent, first line indent)
    Tables
    Table row/column headers
    Table cell coordinates
    Links
    Headings
    Lists
    Block quotes
    Landmarks
    Frames
    When something is clickable "
NVDA,Document Formatting Settings,Announce formatting changes after the cursor,," If enabled, this setting tells NVDA to try and detect all the formatting changes on a line as it speaks it, even if doing this may slow down NVDA's performance. By default, NVDA will detect the formatting at the position of the System caret / Review Cursor, and in some instances may detect formatting on the rest of the line, only if it is not going to cause a performance decrease. Enable this option while proof reading documents in applications such as Microsoft Word, where formatting is important. "
NVDA,Speech dictionaries,,," The speech dictionaries menu (found in the Preferences menu) contains dialogs that allow you to manage the way NVDA pronounces particular words or phrases. There are currently three different types of speech dictionaries. They are:

    Default: rules in this dictionary affect all speech in NVDA.
    Voice: rules in this dictionary affect speech for the synthesizer voice currently being used.
    Temporary: rules in this dictionary affect all speech in NVDA, but only for the current session. These rules are temporary and will be lost if NVDA is restarted. 

You need to assign custom gestures using the Input Gestures dialog if you wish to open any of these dictionary dialogs from anywhere.

All dictionary dialogs contain a list of rules which will be used for processing the speech. The dialog also contains Add, Edit and Remove buttons.

To add a new rule to the dictionary, press the Add button, and fill in the fields in the dialog box that appears and then press Ok. You will then see your new rule in the list of rules. However to make sure your rule is actually saved, make sure to press Ok to exit the dictionary dialog all together once you have finished adding/editing rules.

The rules for NVDA's speech dictionaries allow you to change one string of characters into another. A simple example would be that you want to have NVDA say the word frog each time it is supposed to say the word bird. In the Add rule dialog, the easiest way to do this is to type the word bird in the Pattern field, and the word frog in the Replacement field. You may also want to type a description of the rule in the Comment field (something like: changes bird to frog).

NVDA's speech dictionaries however are much more powerful than simple word replacement. The Add rule dialog also contains a checkbox to say whether or not you want the rule to be case sensitive (meaning that NVDA should care whether the characters are uppercase or lowercase. NVDA ignores case by default).

Finally, a set of radio buttons allows you to tell NVDA whether your pattern should match anywhere, should only match if it is a complete word or should be treated as a ""Regular expression"". Setting the pattern to match as a whole word means that the replacement will only be made if the pattern does not occur as part of a larger word; i.e. a character other than an alphanumeric character or an underscore (or no character at all) comes both immediately before and after the pattern. Thus, using the earlier example of replacing the word ""bird"" with ""frog"", if you were to make this a whole word replacement, it would not match ""birds"" or ""bluebird"".

A regular expression is a pattern containing special symbols that allow you to match on more than one character at a time, or match on just numbers, or just letters, as a few examples. Regular expressions are not covered in this user guide, but there are many tutorials on the web which can provide you with more information. "
NVDA,Punctuation/symbol pronunciation,,," This dialog allows you to change the way punctuation and other symbols are pronounced, as well as the symbol level at which they are spoken.

The language for which symbol pronunciation is being edited will be shown in the dialog's title. Note that this dialog respects the ""Trust voice's language for processing symbols and characters"" option found in the Voice Settings dialog; i.e. it uses the voice language rather than the NVDA global language setting when this option is enabled.

To change a symbol, first select it in the Symbols list.

    The Replacement field allows you to change the text that should be spoken in place of this symbol.
    Using the Level field, you can adjust the lowest symbol level at which this symbol should be spoken.
    The Send actual symbol to synthesizer field specifies when the symbol itself (in contrast to its replacement) should be sent to the synthesizer. This is useful if the symbol causes the synthesizer to pause or change the inflection of the voice. For example, a comma causes the synthesizer to pause. There are three options:
        never: Never send the actual symbol to the synthesizer.
        always: Always send the actual symbol to the synthesizer.
        only below symbols' level: Send the actual symbol only if the configured speech symbol level is lower than the level set for this symbol. For example, you might use this so that a symbol will have its replacement spoken at higher levels without pausing, while still being indicated with a pause at lower levels. 

You can add new symbols by pressing the Add button. In the dialog that appears, enter the symbol and press the OK button. Then, change the fields for the new symbol as you would for other symbols.

You can remove a symbol you previously added by pressing the Remove button.

When you are finished, press the OK button to save your changes or the Cancel button to discard them. "
NVDA,Input Gestures,,," In this dialog, you can customize the input gestures (keys on the keyboard, buttons on a braille display, etc.) for NVDA commands.

Only commands that are applicable immediately before the dialog is opened are shown. For example, if you want to customize commands related to browse mode, you should open the Input Gestures dialog while you are in browse mode.

The tree in this dialog lists all of the applicable NVDA commands grouped by category. You can filter them by entering one or more words from the command's name into the Filter by edit box in any order. Any gestures associated with a command are listed beneath the command.

To add an input gesture to a command, select the command and press the Add button. Then, perform the input gesture you wish to associate; e.g. press a key on the keyboard or a button on a braille display. Often, a gesture can be interpreted in more than one way. For example, if you pressed a key on the keyboard, you may wish it to be specific to the current keyboard layout (e.g. desktop or laptop) or you may wish it to apply for all layouts. In this case, a menu will appear allowing you to select the desired option.

To remove a gesture from a command, select the gesture and press the Remove button.

When you are finished making changes, press the OK button to save them or the Cancel button to discard them. "
